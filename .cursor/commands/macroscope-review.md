# /review-macroscope — Custom Cursor Command

## Purpose
Review and triage comments posted by **Macroscope** on the current pull request before merging.

## Instructions

When invoked, perform the following:

### 1. Fetch Macroscope Comments
Identify all comments on the PR authored by the Macroscope integration. These typically include:
- Code quality observations
- Potential bugs or anti-patterns
- Performance concerns
- Security flags

### 2. Categorize by Severity
Group comments into:
| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Must fix before merge—security issues, breaking logic, data loss risks |
| 🟠 **Warning** | Should address—performance, maintainability, unclear logic |
| 🟡 **Suggestion** | Nice to have—style, minor refactors, optional improvements |
| ⚪ **Info** | No action needed—context, explanations, acknowledgments |

### 3. Generate Action Checklist
For each 🔴 Critical and 🟠 Warning item, produce:
[File:Line] Brief description of issue
└─ Suggested fix or approach

### 4. Summarize for Merge Decision
Provide a clear recommendation:
- **✅ SAFE TO MERGE** — No critical or warning items, or all have been addressed
- **⚠️ MERGE WITH CAUTION** — Warnings present but acceptable risk
- **🛑 DO NOT MERGE** — Critical issues remain unresolved
